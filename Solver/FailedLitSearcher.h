/**
@brief Responsible for doing failed var searching and related algorithms

Performs in seach():
1) Failed lit searching
2) Searching for lits that have been propagated by both "var" and "~var"
3) 2-long Xor clauses that have been found because when propagating "var" and
   "~var", they have been produced by normal xor-clauses shortening to this xor
   clause
4) If var1 propagates var2 and ~var1 propagates ~var2, then var=var2, and this
   is a 2-long XOR clause, this 2-long xor is added
5) Hyper-binary resolution

Perfoms in asymmBranch(): asymmetric branching, heuristically. Best paper
on this is 'Vivifying Propositional Clausal Formulae', though we do it much
more heuristically
