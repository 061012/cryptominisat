# Delete unwanted flags for C compilation
# Distutils has the lovely feature of providing all the same flags that
# Python was compiled with. The result is that adding extra flags is easy,
# but removing them is a total pain. Doing so involves subclassing the
# compiler class, catching the arguments and manually removing the offending
# flag from the argument list used by the compile function.
# That's the theory anyway, the docs are too poor to actually guide you
# through what you have to do to make that happen.
