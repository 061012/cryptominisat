\section{Introduction}
This paper presents the defining features of the conflict-driven clause-learning SAT solver \emph{forl}. \emph{forl} aims to be a modern SAT Solver that unifies the ideas present in SatELite~\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/EenB05}, PrecoSat~\cite{precosat}, glucose~\cite{glucose} and  MiniSat~\cite{EenS03MiniSat} with some ideas of the author.

\section{Primary features}

\subsection{Binary implication graphs}
An implication cache mechanism is employed that stores the binary implication graph similarly to stamps~\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/HeuleJB11}. Stamps are also used, as they have been found to aid along with the cache.

\subsection{Clause cleaning}
Clauses are cleaned regularly, but neither activities nor glues are used in the cleaning. Instead, the number of times a clause helped to propagate or caused a conflict is used as a measure of the effectiveness. This measure is reset after every cleaning, so clauses have to regularly prove themselves effective to stay in the database.

\subsection{Implicit Clauses}
Binary and tertiary clauses are stored and handled implicitly. This greatly eases their subsumption and strengthening. Further, it reduces the cost of creating occurrence lists out of these clauses. Implicit clauses are never cleaned.

\subsection{Statistics}
\emph{forl} gathers large amounts of running statistics. Unfortunately they are not yet used to direct search. However, they can be gathered into MySQL and displayed in a web browser. Importing statistics into the database incurs setup costs and about 10\% running cost and so is disabled by default.

\subsection{Timing}
For average problems inprocesing techniques tend to work well. However, in case of strange problems (such as problems with billions of binary clauses) they sometimes misbehave. This has been solved with more precise time measurements (measuring effort, not actual time) and sometimes complicated time-out checks.

\subsection{Memory usage}
Memory usage has been greatly improved with precise tracking of where memory is being used. Although memory leaks are not generally an issue given the programming techniques used, temporary allocation of large data structures was a problem. These issues have been fixed through algorithmic means: e.g. through the use of circular swapping for variable renumbering.

\subsection{Hyper-binary resolution and transitive reduction}
On-the-fly hyper-binary resolution~\cite{DBLP:conf/sat/BacchusW03} and transitive reduction has been implemented in both DFS and BFS probing for both irreducible and reducible binaries. This helps on instances with generally acceptable number of binary clauses. For problems with too many binary clauses, transitive reduction can take too much time. Such cases are detected and transitive reduction is turned off.

\section{Miscellaneous optimisations}
