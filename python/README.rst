pycryptosat: bindings to the CryptoMiniSat SAT solver
===========================================

This package provides Python bindings to CryptoMiniSat on the C++ level,
i.e. when importing pycryptosat, the CryptoMiniSat solver becomes part of the
Python process itself. This package is based on work by Ilan Schnell, who
provided the binding as MIT licence, which it stays, though it links to
CryptoMiniSat which is LGPL.

Usage
-----

The ``pycryptosat`` module has one object, Solver which has two functions
``solve`` and ``add_clause``, both of which take a clause as an argument.
Aclause is represented as an iterable of (non-zero) integers.

The function ``solve()`` returns one of the following:
  * one solution (a list of integers)
  * the string "UNSAT" (when the clauses are unsatisfiable)
  * the string "UNKNOWN" (when a solution could not be determined within the
    propagation limit)

The function ``solve()`` can take an argument ``assumptions`` that allows
the user to set values to specific variables in the solver in a temporary
fashion. This means that in case the problem is satisfiable, but e.g it's
unsatisfiable if variable 2 is FALSE, then ``solve([-2])`` will return
UNSAT. However, a subsequent call to ``solve()`` will still return a solution.
If instead of an assumption ``add_clause()`` would have been used, subsequent
``solve()`` calls would have returned unsatisfiable.

``Solver`` takes the following keyword arguments:
  * ``confl_limit``: the propagation limit (integer)
  * ``verbose``: the verbosity level (integer)

Example
-------

Let us consider the following clauses, represented using
the DIMACS `cnf <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form>`_
format::

   p cnf 5 3
   1 -5 4 0
   -1 5 3 4 0
   -3 -4 0

Here, we have 5 variables and 3 clauses, the first clause being
(x\ :sub:`1`  or not x\ :sub:`5` or x\ :sub:`4`).
Note that the variable x\ :sub:`2` is not used in any of the clauses,
which means that for each solution with x\ :sub:`2` = True, we must
also have a solution with x\ :sub:`2` = False.  In Python, each clause is
most conveniently represented as a list of integers.  Naturally, it makes
sense to represent each solution also as a list of integers, where the sign
corresponds to the Boolean value (+ for True and - for False) and the
absolute value corresponds to i\ :sup:`th` variable::

   >>> import pycryptosat
   >>> solver = pycryptosat.Solver()
   >>> solver.add_clause([1, -5, 4])
   >>> solver.add_clause([-1, 5, 3, 4])
   >>> solver.add_clause([-3, -4]])
   >>> pycryptosat.solve()
   [1, -2, -3, 4, 5]

This solution translates to: x\ :sub:`1` = x\ :sub:`4` = x\ :sub:`5` = True,
x\ :sub:`2` = x\ :sub:`3` = False
