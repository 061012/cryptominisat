* Get rid of bugs. Many popped up during development, I am sure.  -> Report all bugs, please! I need a LOT of bugreports
* Make it more C++. There are plenty of areas where this would help. I will do this in time, but a set of ideas would help
* Get rid of Vec.h and other STL-like classes. I don't think we need them
